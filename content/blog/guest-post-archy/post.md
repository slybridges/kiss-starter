Hey there I'm Archy!

As I'm not the default author (that's my brother, Deux), hance I'm overriding the author's attributes for this post.

I could also have set those attributes in an index file in any folder and all articles contained in that folder and sub-folders would have defaulted to me as the author. This is called **the data cascade**, it works with any attribute and is very powerful!

Writing is tiring. Let's now relax for a bit, shall we?
